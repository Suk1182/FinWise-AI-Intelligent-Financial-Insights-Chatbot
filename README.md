## Model and API Integration

### Document Retrieval
FinWise AI uses TF-IDF vectorization to process predefined financial documents and retrieve the most relevant information based on user queries. This allows for fast and efficient document matching.

### Transformer-Based Response Generation
The project uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5 or GPT-4 models for generating natural language responses. To configure the model, update the `openai.api_key` with your personal API key.

---

## Dataset

The project includes a small set of predefined financial documents located in `data/financial_documents.txt`. You can expand this dataset with additional insights to improve the chatbot’s performance and relevance.

---

## Examples

### Example 1: Budgeting
**User:** How should I manage my finances as a new graduate?  
**Assistant:** Based on the financial data, here's some advice: Start by creating a budget, saving for an emergency fund, and investing in retirement accounts.

### Example 2: Cryptocurrency Portfolio
**User:** How do I diversify my cryptocurrency portfolio?  
**Assistant:** To diversify your cryptocurrency portfolio, consider investing in various cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and emerging altcoins to mitigate risk.
